Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n###Project evolution/narrative\r\n\r\n### See Jane Run! \r\n\r\n\r\n### Hey, Where's the README?\r\nHey look, it's [here](https://github.com/rebeccagettys/FinalGenetics/blob/master/README.md)!\r\n### Implementation information\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRebecca Gettys, Olin College Class of 2018 (@rebeccagettys)\r\nLiv Kelley, Olin College Class of 2019 (@livkelley)\r\nErica Lee, Olin College Class of 2019 (@ericalee)\r\n\r\n### Resources We Used\r\nRecursive Levenshtein Distance Example - https://programmingpraxis.com/2014/09/12/levenshtein-distance/\r\nSoftdes professors and NINJAs\r\nJean Huang\r\n[Starter code for GeneFinder softdes project](https://github.com/sd16spring/GeneFinder)\r\n\r\n\r\nModules\r\nPygame - http://pygame.org\r\nPickle and Sys - built in to python.",
