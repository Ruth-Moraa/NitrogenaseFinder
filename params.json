  "body": "###Big Idea/Goal/What is this?/Why did we do this?\r\n \r\nNitrogenase Finder is a genetics tool designed to help find nitrogenase genes within a metagenome; both the gene and metagenome should be in FASTA format. This project was originally born out of a suggestion by Jean Huang, a microbial biology professor at Olin College. We pursued this so that we could learn about the internal functions of the tools such as BLAST and Genius that we used for bioinformatics analysis. \r\n\r\n###Project evolution/narrative\r\n\r\n### See Jane Run! \r\n\r\n\r\n### Hey, Where's the README?\r\nHey look, it's [here](https://github.com/rebeccagettys/FinalGenetics/blob/master/README.md)!\r\n### Implementation information\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRebecca Gettys, Olin College Class of 2018 (@rebeccagettys)\r\nLiv Kelley, Olin College Class of 2019 (@livkelley)\r\nErica Lee, Olin College Class of 2019 (@ericalee)\r\n\r\n### Resources We Used\r\nRecursive Levenshtein Distance Example - https://programmingpraxis.com/2014/09/12/levenshtein-distance/\r\nSoftdes professors and NINJAs\r\nJean Huang\r\n[Starter code for GeneFinder softdes project](https://github.com/sd16spring/GeneFinder)\r\n\r\n\r\nModules\r\nPygame - http://pygame.org\r\nPickle and Sys - built in to python.",
